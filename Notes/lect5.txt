❓ React Hook ?   (set of functions)
     -- A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features.
       For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function
        components.
    
    -- why we use ?
      --for 
        -Functional Components
        -Reusing Stateful Logic
        -Simplified State Management
        -Efficient Side-Effect Handling
        -Improved Readability
        -No Need for HOCs or Render Props (Higher Order Components)
        -Improved Performance

❓ what is useState ?
    --useState is a React Hook that allows you to add and manage state
     in functional components. It returns a state variable and a function 
     to update that variable. This Hook is used to maintain component-specific
     data that can change over time and trigger re-renders when the state is updated.

     eg - 
        import React, { useState } from 'react';

           function Counter() {
             const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
           
             return (
               <div>
                 <p>Count: {count}</p>
                 <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
               </div>
             );
           }
